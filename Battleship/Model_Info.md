## Battleship model

### Battleship_Initial.m
This program will simulate a variation of the battleship game called rowboat.

### Battleship_Final.m
This program will build on the battleship game made by us in 'Battleship_Initial.m'.
Where that code just placed boats on the map, this code aims to actually play the game and sink the ships.
