## Monte Carlo (MC) Simulation

This program runs a Monte Carlo simulation to get the probability of getting the roll value of two 
6-sided die in a game of Monopoly. Roll value refers to the values between 1-12. 
This program will find out the individual probabilities of getting each of those numbers.
